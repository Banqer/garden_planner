# ðŸŒ± Garden Planner ðŸŒ±

An example Rails app to discuss in interviews.

We've stayed very close to standard Rails idioms here, so it should be similar to what you'd see in a Rails textbook. Our real code isn't always so tidy!

You're invited to explore the code and discuss what you see. To get started, you might want to have a look at the directories

- /app
- /db
- /spec

and the files

- /config/routes.rb
- /Gemfile
